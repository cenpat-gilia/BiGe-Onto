# Welcome to BioOnto proyect

An ontology developed with researchers from [CENPAT](http://www.cenpat-conicet.gob.ar/). 
The proposed model enables interoperability and a common knowledge representation among databases [SNDB](http://datos.sndb.mincyt.gob.ar/) and [OBIS](http://www.iobis.org/), allowing
the retrieval of information that cannot be gathered by any of the individual information sources alone. 

To know the details of its development, we invite you to give a tour by our wiki, clicking [here](https://github.com/cenpat-gilia/BioOnto/wiki).

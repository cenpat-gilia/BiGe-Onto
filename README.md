# Welcome to BiGe-Onto proyect.

BiGe-Onto is an Ontology-Based System for Managing Biodiversity and Biogeography Data developed by [CENPAT](http://www.cenpat-conicet.gob.ar/) researchers in collaboration with the [GILIA](http://faiweb.uncoma.edu.ar/index.php/investigacion-y-postgrado/80-investigacion-y-postgrado/investigacion/389-grupo-gilia) research group, the Computer Science and Engineering Department [DCIC](https://cs.uns.edu.ar/home/) and the Electric and Computer Engineering Department [DIEC](http://www.diec.uns.edu.ar/).

The proposed system enables interoperability and a common knowledge representation among databases [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) and [OBIS](http://www.iobis.org/), allowing the retrieval of information that cannot be gathered by any of the individual information sources alone. 

To know the details of its development, we invite you to give a tour by our wiki, clicking [here](https://github.com/cenpat-gilia/BiGe-Onto/wiki).
